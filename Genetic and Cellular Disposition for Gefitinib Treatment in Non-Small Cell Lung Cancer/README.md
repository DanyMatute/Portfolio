# Genetic and Cellular Disposition for Gefitinib Treatment in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
## Abstract
The epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane receptor which binds to growth factors. The complex stimulates EGFR’s tyrosine kinase (TK) to conduct protein phosphorylation leading to cell proliferation. 

Cancer could result from a malfunction in the EGFR system. 

Gefitinib is a TK inhibitor capable of reducing tumor size in patients who have the L858R mutation. However, many studies prove that overtime cells become resistant to the inhibitor and other evidence suggest that it can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), consequentially accelerating the disease. 

In this study, the susceptibility of A549 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to undergo EMT was evaluated to determine if exposure to Gefitinib would induce transition. 
Furthermore, a mutational analysis would determine if the subject has an affinity for Gefitinib. 

It’s reported that the subject has markers indicating an inclination of undergoing EMT. It was also found that the subject does not carry the mutation. The introduction of Gefitinib would just accelerate the disease.
