The rate of de novo genome assembly has drastically increased along with the various 
sequencing technologies and genome assembling methods. Here I will discuss the approach 
and quality of Solanum stenotomun’s genome assembly by Yan et al. (2021). Sst will then be 
compared to (1) Solanum chacoense (Sch), a related diploid potato (Leisner et al., 2018), and 
(2) Sinonovacula constricta (Sct), commonly known as the razor clam (Dong et al., 2020). A 
summary of the assembly and assembly statistics of all three organisms is depicted in Table 


Genomic studies of potato varieties, like the diploid plant Solanum stenotomun (Sst), is a 
reserve of gene and allelic diversity which may improve the yield, yield quality, disease and 
climate change resistance of the cultivated potato, Solanum tuberosum (Yan et al., 2021). As 
the world’s third most important food crop, feeding over 1 billion people, it is important to 
find gene and allelic variation to assure our future food security as potato production is 
threatened by disease and climate change (International Potato Center, n.d.).
