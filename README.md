# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio, where I'm proud to share project to some case studies, scientific research and reports I've produced on during my learning path in Data Analytics, Data science, Bioinformatics, Synthetic Biology, Molecular Biology and more. 

The majority of these projects were carried out as a part of one of the following educational programs: 

* *Master of Science in Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology at the University of Edinburgh.* 

* *Bachelors of Science in Biology with a concentration in Biotechnology and Molecular Biology at George Mason University.*

* *Complete Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp 2023.*
