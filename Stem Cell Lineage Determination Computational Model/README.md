Embryonic stem cells can differentiate into distinct cell type. The aim is to understand how to reprogram these differentiated cells back to the embryonic stem cell, to do so one must understand the mechanism behind it. 

There is a subset of transcription factors (TF) that are responsible for...
1. the initial differentiation and/or maintenance of a steady state and subsequently and
2. the possible reprogram back to self-renewing and pluripotent stem cells. 

A mathematical model on lineage determination is possible to derive due to the limited number of TF involved in the process and the functional quantification of the system via ChIP-on-chip and microarray analysis.

The model could simulate new scenarios, such as reprograming, and aid us with understanding the behaviours expressed by the system.

The primary TF, Oct4, is responsible for many of the interactions occurring in the system. Its concentration seems to be the determining factor of the fate of the cell as seen in its switch like inducing behaviour while interacting with Nanog and gata-6. 
This would suggest that Oct4 will play an important role in future experiments regarding the return to stem-cell like status.
