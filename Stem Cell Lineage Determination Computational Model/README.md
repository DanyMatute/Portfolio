Embryonic stem cells can differentiate into distinct cell type. The aim is to understand how to reprogram these differentiated cells back to the embryonic stem cell, to do so one must understand the mechanism behind it. There is a subset of transcription factors (TF) that are responsible for (1) the initial differentiation and/or maintenance of a steady state and subsequently (2) the possible reprogram back to self-renewing and pluripotent stem cells. A mathematical model on lineage determination is possible to derive due to the limited number of TF involved in the process and the functional quantification of the system via ChIP-on-chip and microarray analysis. The model could simulate new scenarios, such as reprograming, and aid us with understanding the behaviours expressed by the system.
